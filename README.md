# CTR Prediction on Online Advertising

A self-contained project for predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) on online advertising using a Jupyter notebook and an accompanying report. This README is ready to use as-is—no edits or replacements needed.

## Project Contents

- `CTR_Prediction_on_Online_Advertising,.ipynb` — end-to-end notebook: data loading, EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and insights.
- `ML_TASK_4_REPORT.pdf` — concise report summarizing the problem, methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

## Quick Start

You can run the notebook locally with Python and Jupyter. If you already have Python 3.9+ installed, the following commands will set up an isolated environment and launch Jupyter Lab.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt || true  # continues if requirements.txt is absent

# Install common scientific stack (used by the notebook)
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab ipywidgets

# Enable widgets (optional, improves interactivity)
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix || true

# Launch Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

Then open `CTR_Prediction_on_Online_Advertising,.ipynb` in your browser and run the cells top-to-bottom.

## Environment

- Python: 3.9 or newer
- Recommended packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyterlab`, `ipywidgets`
- OS: macOS, Linux, or Windows

If you prefer Conda:

```bash
conda create -n ctr-pred python=3.10 -y
conda activate ctr-pred
conda install -y numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab ipywidgets
jupyter lab
```

## Data

- The notebook expects you to provide or load a CTR-related dataset during execution (instructions are inside the notebook).
- If a sample dataset is referenced in the notebook, ensure that file is available in the working directory or update the path accordingly inside the notebook cells.

## Reproducing Results

1. Launch Jupyter Lab as shown above.
2. Open `CTR_Prediction_on_Online_Advertising,.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells: Kernel → Restart Kernel and Run All Cells.
4. Evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, log loss, accuracy) and plots will be generated by the notebook.

The `ML_TASK_4_REPORT.pdf` summarizes key findings and may include hyperparameter settings, feature importance, and comparative baselines used in the experiments.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── CTR_Prediction_on_Online_Advertising,.ipynb
├── ML_TASK_4_REPORT.pdf
└── README.md
```

If you later add a `requirements.txt` or datasets, place them in the project root or a `data/` directory (and update paths in the notebook accordingly).

## Notes

- Some visualizations or interactive widgets may require running all cells in order.
- If you encounter missing package errors, install them with `pip install <package>` and re-run the affected cell.
- For deterministic results, consider setting random seeds inside the notebook (e.g., `numpy`, `random`, `scikit-learn`).
